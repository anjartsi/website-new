			<p>
				I made this page when I was a High school teacher. I never liked calling on students because I would always choose the good students who knew the answer to any question I ever asked them. I was always self-conscious of appearing to "pick on" the lazy kids, so I decided the only fair thing to do would be to create utter chaos (thank you Harvey Dent). 
			</p>
			<p>
				My first idea (the prototype of this page) was to assign each student a number, then draw cards out of a deck, but that got boring real fast (actually it was quite entertaining, but it would waste a good deal of time and create a mess on my desk) and a new solution had to be found.   
			</p>
			<p>
				My favorite thing about this page (an idea I randomly came up with halfway through the project) is the "Chances of Getting Picked" feature. What it does is pretty obvious: it shows the students that haven't been called on yet what their odds are of being the next one chosen. I always took pleasure in seeing the fear in students' eyes as the percentage got bigger and bigger, the questions got harder and harder, and they had <b>NO idea</b> what was going on. What makes this section my favorite is its unique combination of "statistics" meets "sadistic" [insert evil laugh]. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another reason why I made this page was to share it with other teachers at the school, so I made it very easy to customize: all you have to do is replace "Student 1", "Student 2", etc. with your class roster (the size of the class does not matter). I had 5 copies on my classroom desktop: one for each of my classes. I was planning on some additional features, but I stopped being a teacher and this project got put on hold indefinitely. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I know what you're thinking: "Why go through all this trouble? Why not just call on students in alphabetical order? Or go through the class chair by chair?" Well I thought of that, but ultimately decided I don't want students to know when they're being called on (why make it easier for them?)
